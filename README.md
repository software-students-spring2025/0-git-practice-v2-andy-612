## What I found interesting

Coverage on DeepSeek was all over the news today, and it spurred panick among investors in AI because the company behind DeepSeek was able to train the recently released DeepSeek R1 with many times lower than the cost required to train OpenAI's GPT models, for example. The article quoted about $6MM to train DeepSeek's new system. This is extremely low compared to the hundreds of millions that other companies spent to train a somewhat equivalent version.

My interpretation is that as the investors and engineers adjust their perspectives and find more efficient ways, or imitate DeepSeek's bootstrapped process, to train new models, the pay for development/engineering jobs related to AI would come down as well. Overall, it was very interesting to see how the stock market reacted to this news today and how the sell-off related to NVIDIA panned out.

The AI boom has, in my opinion, been somewhat a bubble - like the .com bubble before it, as well as blockchain to a degree, AI has become the buzzword of the day, becoming a necessity for any given startup to engage with, even if its not really an applicable technology. I think DeepSeek is the start of that bubble popping, and we'll see way fewer AI jobs stateside as it becomes clearer that the overinvestment in it is unnecessary.
